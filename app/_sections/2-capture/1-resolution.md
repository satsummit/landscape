# Resolution.

---

### High resolution commercial imagery is available up to .31m resolution.

While there is still a premium for the highest resolution imagery (<0.50m), medium to low resolution is suitable for many applications, and increasingly affordable or available at no cost.

### What resolution do I need?

The imagery samples below can help select the right imagery for your project.

In an urban environment like Fortaleza, free Landsat imagery (15m) shows the extent of the city. Medium resolution imagery like RapidEye (5m) shows roads. With Worldview 3 (.31m) and Pleiades (.5m) images you can count beach umbrellas.

### Resolution versus accuracy

*Resolution* refers to the size one pixel in the image has on the ground. For example 15 meters means that one pixel on the image corresponds to a square of 15 by 15 meters on the ground.

*Pansharpening*. Often satellites take images of lower resolution in many bands (e.g. Multispectral red, green and blue for a color image), and then have another channel with much wider spectral range (i.e. "panchromatic") with finer resolution. By means of a mathematical relations, it is possible to pan-sharpen the multispectral image with the panchromatic resolution.

*Accuracy*. Resolution refers to the size of the pixel. Accuracy refers to the possible difference between the reported locations on the images and their actual location in the real world. A usual standard is a 90% likelihood within a Circular Area around the location (CE90). To ensure accuracy, satellite images are ortho-rectified for orography with either an elevation model, or using Ground Control Points (GCP).
